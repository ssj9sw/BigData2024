I live in ambler so I was so happy to see one opening less than 10 min down the street from me. This morning I went around noon and was horribly disappointed. \\nThere was no wait and I was seated right away, the waitress was very nice, I ordered a Wilbur skillet with poached eggs and an iced coffee. The coffee came pretty quick and then in a reasonable amount of time my skillet showed up. \\nMy \"poached eggs\" that had a yolk that was harder than the yolk of a hard boiled egg were sitting atop some dry ass potatoes with cheese that had crusted over. I grab the waitress and told her the eggs were beyond overcooked. She asked if I wanted new ones and I said just bring me 2 poached eggs. She said no problem and she would have the \"manger\" come over. Before he did the waitress brought me out a new order of poached eggs. This time, comically, they were the same as the fist batch....hard boiled At this time the manager, who looked like a disheveled man who had no clue, came over to tell me I wouldn't be charged for my skillet. I said I hope not and by the way this isn't a poached egg either and showed him my replacement egg. He said yeah i guess that is a little overbooked and WALKED AWAY Great manager. \\nI felt bad for the waitress who tried her best to cover for all the mess ups. But after 2 failed attempts I ended up leaving hungry. Basically you would be better off eating elsewhere.</td>\n",

The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.   \n",

The decor is very nice, and I like what the restaurant is trying to do, with healthy food options but the service is poor. My mother and I waited over an hour to get our entrees and our server never apologized for the wait or came to check to see if we needed anything. I ordered the big easy benedict, which was supposed to have chorizo sausage and I literally had maybe 5 small slices of chorizo and the rest of my dish were the eggs and vegetables. Definitely not worth the money. I will give one star for the decor and one star for the manager who did stop by our table to take our drink and food orders when our waitress disappeared and did try to keep an eye on us from time to time. Their servers definitely need some training as well. Two of the people who brought food to our table did not know what dishes they were serving us and said the wrong names when they served our food/drinks. I don't see any reason to go back here.   \n",

Horrible experience- we waited 45 minutes to get our food. I asked for a manager who brought our food out several minutes later and stated the reason we did not receive our food was because the order wasn't put in til 13 minutes ago. Which means the waitress that took our order neglected to put it in. How do you forget to put in an order??? Grant it we ended up getting the food for free but the avacado toast looked rushed and had too much oil on it and the tuna melt had way too much tuna. I may give this place another chance only because  past experience wasn't so bad but they definitely lost my boyfriend as a customer.   \n",

The service is extremely slow. Expect 75-90 minutes per trip. Last time I went with my wife, we had to go through 5 sets of silverware before we were able to get a clean knife and fork. Coffee cups were dirty. Food took over an hour to get to our table. \\n\\nFood is inconsistent as well. Sometimes they cook the veggies down before putting them in your omelette, most times they don't. \\n\\nCoffee is great here and I enjoy the menu, but management needs to step it up.   \n",

Had high hopes for this joint and it turned out to be rather lack-luster... the service was awful, food bland, and order came out completely wrong. The menu sounds so delicious but when it came down to it was not worth the price. Better off going to Harvest which is in the same shopping center. I really don't understand how they remain busy - I would not recommend to anyone.   \n",

Got on the yelp waitlist almost an hour ago. It said 15-30 minutes. I arrived 20 minutes later and checked in at the front desk. That was 30 minutes ago and we are still waiting being #6  on the queue. Not only that but all the people waiting are packed into a tiny vestibule.   \n",
       "9   What a mess. Let me start by saying I've been to the Turning point in warrington 3 times before and loved it. I live in ambler so I was so happy to see one opening less than 10 min down the street from me. This morning I went around noon and was horribly disappointed. \\nThere was no wait and I was seated right away, the waitress was very nice, I ordered a Wilbur skillet with poached eggs and an iced coffee. The coffee came pretty quick and then in a reasonable amount of time my skillet showed up. \\nMy \"poached eggs\" that had a yolk that was harder than the yolk of a hard boiled egg were sitting atop some dry ass potatoes with cheese that had crusted over. I grab the waitress and told her the eggs were beyond overcooked. She asked if I wanted new ones and I said just bring me 2 poached eggs. She said no problem and she would have the \"manger\" come over. Before he did the waitress brought me out a new order of poached eggs. This time, comically, they were the same as the fist batch....hard boiled At this time the manager, who looked like a disheveled man who had no clue, came over to tell me I wouldn't be charged for my skillet. I said I hope not and by the way this isn't a poached egg either and showed him my replacement egg. He said yeah i guess that is a little overbooked and WALKED AWAY Great manager. \\nI felt bad for the waitress who tried her best to cover for all the mess ups. But after 2 failed attempts I ended up leaving hungry. Basically you would be better off eating elsewhere.   \n",

Shashuka was basically tomato soup with no flavor and poached eggs instead of actually Shashuka where eggs are cooked with dish. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because manager and service was excellent. They waived fee for shashuka and gave us classics eggs Benedict which was just the way I expected and remembered it.   \n",

Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.   \n",

They have free wifi, plenty of seating, and play indie music on low volume. Good Karma also has an outdoor oasis in the back which it seems not many know about. Wouldn't say this is the place for coffee connoisseurs because I don't think they roast or brew their own coffee. However drinks are solidly delicious and unique. And ambiance is very chill.   \n",

Saturday morning adventures. This is not a chain, it doesn't look like anywhere else we sat outside in back and listened to the sound of the fountain. Pretty nice and good coffee   \n",

There is a ton of space and many tables of different sizes. The coffee is good although seems expensive for the quality. Downfall is that it is cash only.   \n",

(sometimes they are reserved though) \\n\\nEven though I have never able to finish a cup of their coffee... and their foods are not great either.\\n\\nIt's still great cafe considering the concept of cafe and ignore the coffee quality, because the staffs are friendly, they have big tables, and always paintings on walls. \\nYes, great place for het finish works. \\n\\nI will go different cafe for good coffee, and will come here for good space and good karma.   \n",
